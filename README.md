# Project Pizzeria

A simple pizzeria where user can fill in their answers to the questions in order to choose food and place order. 

## The problem

The project makes use of:
- Javascript methods such as prompt() and alert() to receive the user's input and display confirmation of their choices or error messages on screen
- Conditional statements and array to handle the user's different input choices, including the invalid ones

Potential improvements may include adding functions to make the program return to the previous step instead of exiting when the user put in an invalid answer, adding HTML and CSS to make it really a website.
